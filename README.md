# Node Chat Server

Everyone should have made a chat server in Node.js. This is mine.

## Usage

Run the server:

    $ node chat.js

Connect via telnet:

    $ telnet localhost 8000

Type anything to chat, or prefix it with "/" to send a command.

### Commands

* `/nick <name>` - Change your nickname.

## I love you

Johannes Gorset made this. You should [tweet me](https://twitter.com/jgorset) if you can't get it to
work. In fact, you should tweet me anyway.
